    <h1>A4: Libraries</h1>
    <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 4!</p>
    <h1>Schematic</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A4Schematic.jpg" />
      <p>This is the schematic for the A4 assignment. 
        I picked the value 5 ohms for my resistor because this is a common
        configuration as a pull down/pull up resistor. Furthermore, this value
        was used because we wanted the current to be super slow.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Arduino Board Photo</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A4Circuit.jpg" />
      <p>This is Arduino Board setup I used to get my capacitive sensors to turn the motor. 
        I purposely set separate input wires for the capacitive sensors to pin 2 and 4.
        This is so that one acts as GND while the other is used as the input for the sensor.
        For the motor, I configured the necessary wires into each and connected the sensor to
        the movement of the motor via code using two libraries. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Video GIF</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A4.gif" />
      <p>This is a video GIF of the capacitive sensor being used to turn the motor.
        Everytime the capactitive sensor recieves an input via being touched, it increases
        the current and creates a connection to ground which then sends a input to move the motor.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Code Snippet</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <a href="A4Code" target="_blank">Link to Code Snippet</a>
    </div>
      <p>This is the code snippet used to make my capacitive sensor work in sync 
        with the motor. I added lines of code to map the necessary values for the range
        that I wanted the motor to move at. Furthermore, I added lines such that the motor
        moves only when the capacitive sensor reacts. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A4Q1.jpg" />
      <p> 
       These are the answers for the questions in A4. 
       2. //Create new variable r 
       if Random(100) == 50; //This makes the code randomize out of 100 which is 1 percent
       r results in an error now
       else r = analogRead(inputPin);

       3. //Create variable r and read the value given
       r = analogRead(inputPin);
       //Create variable e to code error
       e = random(-0.1r, 0.1r); //This generates a value between the range of -10 and 10 percent of the error
       //Then add the values from variable e to r.
       r += e;
