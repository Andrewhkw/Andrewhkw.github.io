    <h1>A3: Input and Output</h1>
    <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 3!</p>
    <h1>Schematic</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A3Schema.jpg" />
      <p>This is the schematic for the A3 assignment. 
        I picked the value 220 for the resistor because I used the equation 5V - 1.8V = (20*10^-3)R. 5V represents the 
        initial voltage and 1.8 represents the voltage drop. (20*20^-3) represents the 
        20mA desired current. I also used this equation for the button's resistor
        and got the closest resistor value to 220 ohms. I chose the 10k resistor
        because resistance is variable and either 5k or 10k resistors could be used.</p>

    <h1>Arduino Board Photo</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A3 Circuit.jpg" />
      <p>This is Arduino Board setup I used to get my LEDs to fade with a photo resistor. 
        I purposely set separate input wires for each LED while having a 
        5V power source connected with an A5 pin controlling current. This also
        allowed me to be able to code each LED separately.
      </p>

    <h1>Video GIF</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A3.mov" />
      <p>This is a video GIF of the LEDs fading in with an input (photo resistor). 
        This video shows how the arduino code was used to cause a fading pattern with the
        two different LEDs based on how much light the photo resistor recieved. As you can see, 
        the fading began only after covering the photo resistor completely.
      </p>

    <h1>Code Snippet</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A3CodeSnippet1.jpg" />
      <img src="A3CodeSnippet2.jpg" />
    </div>
      <p>This is the code snippet used to fade my LEDs using the values set by my photo resistor.
        The LEDs will recieve power based on the current set by the photo resistor. In this case,
        the LEDs will recieve more current with more light and less current with less light. 
      </p>

    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A3Q1.jpg" />
      <img src="A3Q2.jpg" />
      <img src="A3Q3.jpg" />
      <p> 
       These are the answers for the questions in A3.
