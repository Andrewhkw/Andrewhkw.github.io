      <p>This is the code snippet used to make my LED board blink.
        The idea was to have a loop have the LED light up and delay until
        the next light is commanded to turn on. This is how the blinking
        pattern was created.

    <h1>Schematic</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="Display.jpg" />
      <p>This is the schematic for the wiring done on the circuit board.
        The placement of the wires and LEDs mimicks the actual placement
        of my wires and LEDs on my real board. The resistors should represent
        220 OHMs.

    <h1>Video GIF</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A1Vid.gif" />
      <p>This is a video GIF of the LEDs blinking in action. This shows
        how the arduino code was used to cause a blinking pattern with the
        three different LEDs. 
      </p>

    <h1>Circuit Board</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="Circuit.jpg" />
      <p>I picked the value 220 for the resistor because I used the equation
         5V - 1.8V = (20*10^-3)R. 5V represents the initial voltage and 1.8 represents
         the voltage drop. (20*20^-3) represents the 20mA desired current. 
      </p>

    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="Graph.jpg" />
      <p> 
        1: The picture to the left shows the graph for question #1.
        2: Arduino Uno has 14 pins so it could power 14 individual LEDs.
        This would draw 280 mA of current because 20mA required per LED multiplied
        by 14 individual LEDs gives us 280mA of current. 
        3: The technical answer I googled was that the flicker fusion threshold
        is around 60-90 Hz. Anything above this would appear to be fading in and out.
        The less technical answer would be around 100ms as that is what I set my
        Arduino delay time to and it seemed to be fading in and out rather than blinking.
